# autocmd is a tool to reuse command lines you've written last time
# in the current directory. In addition to that, autocommand can suggest
# commands based on the content of the current directory.
#
# autocommand is initiated with control + space + space.
#
# The name autocmd does not refer to the vim command of the same name
# but to the autojump tool from Joel Schaerer.

# kudos to Bart Schaefer for the completion script
